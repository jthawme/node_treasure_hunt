    You did it! You worked out this was the next file.
    Use \`ls\` whenever you want to see the contents of the folder
    you are currently in.

    You might have also seen the word 'cave'. This is actually
    a folder/directory exactly like you will have seen before. What
    we want to do, is open that folder up so we can see the contents
    in that.

    So what we need to do is to 'change directory' so we are now in
    the 'cave' instead of this folder. So lets learn a new command!

    cd

    \`cd\` is short for Change directory and we can use it for that.

    Type in 'cd cave' and hit enter. Then use ls to see the files in
    there.
