# Treasure Hunt

## Introduction

Welcome to the treasure hunt. What we want to do here is, using `node` and
command line, track down the missing treasure. We will be using command
line commands to navigate around files and then we will use node to execute 
those files.

Inside the files there will be tips to help you track down the treasure.

## What you will need

- You will need access to a computer (which I presume you're using to view this?)
- You will need to install node.js ([https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/))
- You will need to open up your command line (see below)

## Command line

So a command line is just a text interface for a computer to run commands,
and there are different command line programs depending what machine you use.
On Macs there is 'Terminal' and on Windows there is WINDOWS-STUFF-TO-DO.

If this the first time you seeing these, they are kind of the things that 
films use to make people look like _hackers_.

## How to begin

### Mac users

To begin, find this folder in **Finder**. Open up terminal. You can do this 
by opening _spotlight_ (cmd + spacebar) and typing 'Terminal' and it'll show up
as a result.

Then from **Finder** drag this folder onto the terminal icon in your launch bar
and it will open a terminal window at the position of this folder (this will 
get explained further later).

Then type `node start.js`

### Windows users

WINDOWS-STUFF-TO-DO

## If you get stuck

Just close the command line program and go back to how to begin. You can do
a lot of powerful and dangerous things with the command line, but its hard
to do accidentally, so just retrace your steps :)

Happy hunting!
