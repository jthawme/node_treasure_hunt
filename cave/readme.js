    Very well done, expert 'cd' and 'ls'.

    So now you know everything you need to find the treasure.

    - Use \`ls\` to look at what files/folders are in a folder
    - Use \`cd [FOLDER]\` to change directory into a folder
    - Use \`node [FILE]\` to run a file

    Try find the treasure!
    (Start by changing directory into the 'room': type 'cd room')
