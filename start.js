console.log(`


    Welcome! You managed to find the start position, congratulations.
    Now, we will only use terminal commands to navigate around.

    The first command we will learn is this:
        ls
    
    \`ls\` is short for list and it will show us the files that we have in a directory.

    If you type \`ls\` into your command line and press enter, it will show you the contents
    of this folder. When you see the other files you can try work out which file to look at
    ---next---

    Remember, to run javascript files type: 'node [FILENAME]' and hit enter
